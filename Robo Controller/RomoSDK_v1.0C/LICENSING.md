# Romotive SDK

## Licensing

Romotive wants to make it very easy for people to get rolling with our SDK, so here is a "human-readable" summary of our [Terms of Use](http://romotive.com/developers/tos/).

### Read the Terms of Use

Before you access or use the Romotive SDK, you need to read, and make sure you agree with, the [Terms of Use](http://romotive.com/developers/tos/). The Terms of Use is the legal agreement between you and Romotive regarding your access and use of the Romotive SDK. This summary is not legally enforceable and is provided for your convenience only. 

### Use common sense

If you're unsure, ask us. Our [Terms of Use](http://romotive.com/developers/tos/) allow for most reasonable uses. If you're doing something you think might be a problem or if you have any questions, just contact us at <developers@romotive.com>.

### Commercial Use

The Romotive SDK is currently free for commercial, non-commercial, and educational purposes. If you release a commercial application that you built using the Romotive SDK, all we require is that you send us an email to let us know. That's it!

### Respect user privacy

Disclose in your application (through a privacy policy) how you will collect, use, store, and disclose data collected from users.
If your app transmits video, audio, pictures, or other data off of a mobile device, you must prominently notify the user and obtain the user’s opt-in consent. 

### Your brand != our brand

Don't use the name, trademarks, or logos of Romotive without specific prior written permission from Romotive.

### Don't do anything harmful or illegal

Don't use the SDK in connection with anything that promotes or takes part in any products, services, or materials that we would consider harmful. Don’t use the SDK in connection with anything that violates any law or any person’s or entity’s rights.

### Help us keep things under control

Don't use the SDK in a manner that exceeds reasonable request volume for remote server calls, or constitutes abusive usage as determined by Romotive. 

### Build awesome stuff

We want to see people build awesome stuff with our SDK. If you need help, shoot us an email. If something is broken, let us know. If you need a new feature, tell us what it is. And if you build something awesome, show it to us so we can show the world how awesome you are.
